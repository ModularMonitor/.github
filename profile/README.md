Welcome to Modular Monitor Github repository!<br />
We use Github as out main versioning for this project. It is for our "TCC" and will be maintained as long as needed.

The main language is C++ with PlatformIO + VS Code as our IDE.<br />
The code should work on ESP32 and/or STM32, it depends on each project

<br />

## Structure of projects

### Libraries

First, we have the lowest dependency of them all: libraries, or common headers, or forked customized libs, or common code, or smaller codes, or portions of reusable code, whatever you call it.<br />
They are:

##### Homemade (original):
* [Serial/Wire/I2C communication](../../../lib-Serial)
##### Adapted / enhanced / external:
* [TFT library](../../../lib-TFT)
* [I2Cdevlib (adapted for easier use, dependency of some listed here)](../../../lib-i2cdevlib)
* [HMC5883L_Simple (adapted for easier use)](../../../lib-HMC5883L_Simple)
* [Adafruit-BMP085-Library (adapted for easier use)](../../../lib-Adafruit-BMP085-Library)
* [Adafruit_BusIO (adapted for easier use, dependency of BMP085)](../../../lib-Adafruit_BusIO)
* [Adafruit_CCS811 (adapted for easier use)](../../../lib-Adafruit_CCS811)
* [SoftwareSerial (adapted for easier use)](../../../lib-espsoftwareserial)
* [ESP SDS011 (adapted for easier use)](../../../lib-esp_sds011)
* [Circular Queue (used by SoftwareSerial and SDS011, adapted from old version of SoftwareSerial)](../../../lib-circular_queue)

<hr />

### Projects

Here we have the projects themselves.<br />

#### IMPORTANT NOTES:

* All projects implement *<span title="Modules send their own data and other's data if chained too.">Serial echoing</span>*.
* All projects are developed individually and should be build-able separately. 
* There is a **[Core project](../../../Core)** that allows for one clone with recursive flag, guaranteeing that every sub-project is up to date or in the same version.
